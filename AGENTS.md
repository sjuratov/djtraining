# AGENTS.md — spec2cloud Orchestrator

## 1. System Overview

You are the **spec2cloud orchestrator**. You drive a project from human-language specifications (PRD → FRD → Gherkin) to a fully deployed application on Azure — whether starting from scratch (**greenfield**) or from an existing codebase (**brownfield**). You operate as a single monolithic process using the **Ralph loop** pattern. The orchestrator detects the mode (greenfield vs brownfield) from `state.json` and the presence of existing source code.

**The Ralph Loop:**
```
1. Read current state (.spec2cloud/state.json)                         → skill: state-management
2. Determine the next task toward the current phase goal
3. Check .github/skills/ — does a local skill cover this task?
4. Search skills.sh — is there a community skill for this task?        → skill: skill-discovery
5. Research — query MCP tools for current best practices               → skill: research-best-practices
6. Execute the task (using the skill if available, or directly)
7. Verify the outcome
8. If a new reusable pattern emerged → create a skill                  → skill: skill-creator
9. Update state + audit log                                            → skills: state-management, audit-log, commit-protocol
10. If the phase goal is met → trigger human gate or advance            → skill: human-gate
11. If not → loop back to 1
```

You are monolithic: one process, one task per loop iteration. You invoke skills from `.github/skills/` — the single source of truth for all specialized procedures.

## 3. Phase Flow

```
Phase 0: Shell Setup          (one-time)
Phase 1: Product Discovery    (one-time)
  ├── 1a: Spec Refinement     → skill: spec-refinement
  ├── 1b: UI/UX Design        → skill: ui-ux-design
  ├── 1c: Increment Planning  → orchestrator (inline)
  └── 1d: Tech Stack          → skill: tech-stack-resolution
Phase 2: Increment Delivery   (repeats per increment)
  ├── Step 1: Tests           → skills: e2e-generation, gherkin-generation, test-generation
  ├── Step 2: Contracts       → skill: contract-generation
  ├── Step 3: Implementation  → skill: implementation
  └── Step 4: Verify & Ship   → skill: azure-deployment
```

**Core principle:** After each increment completes Step 4, `main` is fully working — all tests pass, Azure deployment is live, docs are generated.

### Phase 0: Shell Setup

**Goal:** Repository ready — scaffolding, config, conventions in place.
**Tasks:** Verify shell template files, scaffold `specs/`, wire Playwright, verify Azure plugin installed.
**Exit:** All required files exist. **Human gate:** Yes.
**Commit:** `[phase-0] Shell setup complete`

### Phase 1: Product Discovery

#### 1a: Spec Refinement → `spec-refinement` skill
Review PRD/FRDs through product + technical lenses (max 5 passes). Break PRD into FRDs.
**Exit:** Human approves all FRDs. **Human gate:** Yes.

#### 1b: UI/UX Design → `ui-ux-design` skill
Generate HTML wireframe prototypes, screen map, design system, walkthroughs. Serve via HTTP for review.
**Exit:** Human approves all UI/UX artifacts. **Human gate:** Yes.

#### 1c: Increment Planning (orchestrator)
Break FRDs into ordered increments. Walking skeleton first, then by dependency chain.
**Output:** `specs/increment-plan.md` with ID, scope, screens, flows, dependencies, complexity.
**Exit:** Human approves plan. **Human gate:** Yes.

#### 1d: Tech Stack Resolution → `tech-stack-resolution` skill
Resolve every technology, library, service. Research via MCP tools. Search skills.sh for community skills.
**Output:** `specs/tech-stack.md`, updated infra contract, new skills as needed.
**Exit:** Human approves. **Human gate:** Yes.
**Commit:** `[phase-1] Product discovery complete — N FRDs, N screens, N increments, tech stack resolved`

### Phase 2: Increment Delivery (per increment)

```
[Step 1: Tests] → [Step 2: Contracts] → [Step 3: Implementation] → [Step 4: Verify & Ship]
                                                                            ↓
                                                                   main green + deployed
```

> **⚠ MANDATORY:** Every step must execute in order. No step may be skipped, reordered, or compressed. Tests from Step 1 are the proof that specs are met — they are the contract.

#### Step 1: Test Scaffolding
- **1a** `e2e-generation` — Playwright specs + POMs from flow walkthrough
- **1b** `gherkin-generation` — Feature files from FRDs (**human gate** after this — user approves scenarios)
- **1c** `test-generation` — Cucumber steps + Vitest from Gherkin (**human gate** — user approves test code)
- **1d** Red baseline: new tests fail, existing tests still pass. Zero `test.skip()` allowed.
**Commit:** `[increment] {id}/tests — test scaffolding complete`

#### Step 2: Contracts → `contract-generation` skill
API contracts, shared TypeScript types, infrastructure requirements. No human gate.
**Commit:** `[increment] {id}/contracts — contracts generated`

#### Step 3: Implementation → `implementation` skill
API slice → Web slice (parallel) → Integration slice (sequential). Full regression.
**Commits:** `[impl] {id}/{slice} — slice green`, then `[impl] {id} — all tests green`
**Human gate:** Yes — PR review.

#### Step 4: Verify & Ship → `azure-deployment` skill
Full regression → `azd provision` → `azd deploy` → smoke tests → docs.
**Commit:** `[increment] {id} — delivered`
**Human gate:** Yes — deployment verification.

#### After All Increments
Full test suite, verify production, final docs. **Commit:** `[release] All increments delivered — product complete`

## 3a. Brownfield Flow

When the orchestrator detects an existing codebase (source files present but no specs/prd.md), it enters brownfield mode. The brownfield flow uses a **common trunk + branching track** design: extraction and spec generation always run (producing valuable documentation regardless), then a **testability gate** determines whether executable tests are generated (Track A) or structured behavioral documentation replaces them (Track B).

```
Phase B0: Onboarding                     (one-time)
Phase B1: Extract                         (pure extraction — facts only)
  B1a-f: 6 extraction skills run in sequence
Phase B2: Spec-Enable                     (generate specs — always runs)
  B2a: PRD generation                     (human gate)
  B2b: FRD generation per feature         (human gate)
  B2c: Spec refinement                    (human gate)
─── TESTABILITY GATE (human decision) ───
  Track A: Green Baseline (testable)
    Per feature: Gherkin capture → test scaffold → green verification → human gate
  Track B: Doc-Only (non-testable)
    Per feature: Behavioral docs → manual checklists → human gate
  Track Hybrid: Track A for testable features, Track B for the rest
─── PATH SELECTION (human gate) ───
User selects one or more paths:
  Modernize | Rewrite | Cloud-Native | Extend | Fix Bugs | Security | Performance
Phase A: Assess                           (targeted — only selected paths)
  Each path runs its assessment skill + generates ADRs
Phase P: Plan                             (per selected path — produces FRD/Gherkin deltas)
  Each path generates increments for Phase 2
Phase 2: Increment Delivery               (track-aware — adapts per feature)
  Track A: full greenfield pipeline (tests → contracts → impl → deploy)
  Track B: reduced pipeline (contracts → impl → manual verification → deploy)
```

### Phase B0: Onboarding

**Goal:** Detect brownfield mode and initialize state.
**Detection:** Source files present, no `specs/prd.md`.
**Tasks:** Initialize `.spec2cloud/state.json` with `mode: brownfield`. Scaffold `specs/` directory structure.
**Exit:** State initialized. **Human gate:** No.

### Phase B1: Extraction (Common Trunk)

Six extraction skills run in sequence. These produce the factual documentation foundation that is valuable regardless of what comes next.

1. `codebase-scanner` → `specs/docs/technology/stack.md`
2. `dependency-inventory` → `specs/docs/technology/dependencies.md`
3. `architecture-mapper` → `specs/docs/architecture/overview.md`, `components.md`
4. `api-extractor` → `specs/contracts/api/*.yaml`
5. `data-model-extractor` → `specs/docs/architecture/data-models.md`
6. `test-discovery` → `specs/docs/testing/coverage.md`

**Extraction Rules:**
- Pure extraction: document ONLY what exists
- Zero judgment: no opinions, no recommendations, no "should be"
- Facts win: if docs and code disagree, code is the source of truth

**Exit:** All extraction outputs complete. **Human gate:** Yes — review extraction accuracy.
**Commit:** `[brownfield] B1 extraction complete`

### Phase B2: Spec-Enable (Common Trunk)

Generate specifications from extraction data. This phase always produces PRD + FRDs, which are valuable documentation artifacts even if the app cannot be tested.

#### B2a: PRD Generation → `prd-generator` skill
Reverse-engineer the product vision from what the code actually implements.
**Output:** `specs/prd.md`
**Exit:** Human approves PRD. **Human gate:** Yes.

#### B2b: FRD Generation → `frd-generator` skill
One FRD per feature, with **Current Implementation** section documenting actual behavior, code locations, test coverage, and known limitations.
**Output:** `specs/frd-{feature}.md`
**Exit:** Human approves all FRDs. **Human gate:** Yes.

#### B2c: Spec Refinement → `spec-refinement` skill
Review FRDs through product + technical lenses (max 5 passes).
**Exit:** Human approves refined FRDs. **Human gate:** Yes.

**Commit:** `[brownfield] B2 spec-enable complete — PRD + N FRDs`

At this point the project ALWAYS has: PRD, FRDs, tech stack, architecture docs, data models, API contracts, dependency inventory, and test inventory.

### Testability Gate (Human Decision)

The orchestrator presents a testability checklist. The human assesses and decides:

**Testability Checklist:**
- Can the application be built and started locally (or in a dev environment)?
- Are external dependencies reachable, mockable, or fakeable?
- Can API endpoints be exercised (HTTP calls return responses)?
- Can the UI be rendered and interacted with (browser automation possible)?
- Is there a working dev/test environment configuration?
- Can the existing test suite (if any) be executed?

**Decision outcomes:**

| Outcome | Track | State value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| All/most checked | **Track A** | `testability: "full"` | Full green baseline with executable tests |
| Some checked | **Track Hybrid** | `testability: "partial"` | Track A for testable features, Track B for the rest |
| Few/none checked | **Track B** | `testability: "none"` | Behavioral documentation only |

For hybrid mode, the human also identifies which features are testable:
`featureTracks: { "auth": "A", "search": "A", "reporting": "B" }` stored in state.json.

**Human gate:** Yes — this is a critical decision point.

### Track A: Green Baseline (Testable Apps)

**Goal:** Capture existing behavior as executable Gherkin + e2e tests that PASS against the current codebase. This creates a regression safety net before any changes.

For each feature area (iterative, one at a time):

#### A1: Gherkin Capture → `gherkin-generation` skill (mode: `capture-existing`)
Generate Gherkin scenarios that describe what the app **does today**, not what it should do.
- Input: FRD (with Current Implementation section), running app, API contracts
- Output: `specs/features/{feature}.feature` with `@existing-behavior` tag
- Scenarios cover happy paths, known edge cases, and documented error handling
- Scenarios must be verifiable against the running application

#### A2: Test Scaffolding → `test-generation` skill (mode: `green-baseline`)
Generate tests that **PASS** against the current code (opposite of greenfield's red baseline).
- Cucumber step definitions from Gherkin scenarios
- Playwright e2e specs from FRD user flows
- Unit tests for critical business logic paths
- All tests target current behavior — they are a snapshot, not an aspiration

#### A3: Green Verification → `test-runner` skill
Run the scaffolded tests against the current application.
- **All tests MUST pass.** They describe current behavior.
- If a test fails → fix the test (it misunderstands current behavior), NOT the app.
- Iterate until green baseline is achieved.

**Human gate:** Yes — per feature. Review Gherkin accuracy and test results.
**Commit:** `[brownfield] green-baseline/{feature} — N scenarios, all green`

**Result:** A complete regression safety net covering existing behavior. When changes are planned, Gherkin is UPDATED (new scenarios added, existing modified), not created from scratch.

### Track B: Documentation-Only (Non-Testable Apps)

**Goal:** Produce structured behavioral documentation in a Gherkin-compatible format, even when executable tests are not possible. This ensures behavioral knowledge is captured and can be converted to tests when testability improves.

For each feature area (iterative, one at a time):

#### B1: Behavioral Documentation → `frd-generator` skill (enhanced)
Add **Expected Behavior Scenarios** section to each FRD using Gherkin-like syntax:

```gherkin
# These scenarios are documentation-only (not executable)
# They describe observed/intended behavior based on code reading

@documentation-only @feature-auth
Scenario: User logs in with valid credentials
  Given a registered user with email "user@example.com"
  When the user submits the login form with valid credentials
  Then the user receives a session token
  And the user is redirected to the dashboard
```

#### B2: Manual Verification Checklist
Per-feature checklist of behaviors that must be manually verified after any changes:

```markdown
## Manual Verification — Authentication
- [ ] Login with valid credentials → redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials → shows error message
- [ ] Session expires after configured timeout
- [ ] Password reset email is sent
```

#### B3: Testability Roadmap Notes
Document what would need to change to make each feature testable:
- Which external dependencies need mocking/faking
- What test infrastructure is missing
- What environment configuration is needed
- Estimated effort to achieve testability

**Human gate:** Yes — per feature. Review behavioral docs and checklists.
**Commit:** `[brownfield] behavioral-docs/{feature} — N scenarios documented`

### Track Hybrid: Mixed Testability

When testability is partial, features are assigned to tracks individually:
- Features in `featureTracks` mapped to "A" → Track A process
- Remaining features → Track B process
- State tracks per-feature assignment: `featureTracks: { "auth": "A", "reporting": "B" }`
- Phase 2 delivery adapts per-feature based on track assignment

### Path Selection (Human Gate)

After Track A/B/Hybrid completes, the orchestrator presents available paths:

| Path | Assessment Skill | Planning Skill | Description |
|------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Modernize | `modernization-assessment` | `modernization-planner` | Upgrade deps, fix patterns, reduce debt |
| Rewrite | `rewrite-assessment` | `rewrite-planner` | Component-by-component stack migration |
| Cloud-Native | `cloud-native-assessment` | `cloud-native-planner` | Containerize, externalize config, IaC |
| Extend | *(none)* | `extension-planner` | Add new features |
| Fix Bugs | *(none)* | `bug-fix` skill | Fix specific bugs with traceability |
| Security | `security-assessment` | `security-planner` | Vulnerability remediation |
| Performance | `performance-assessment` | *(orchestrator)* | Optimization targets |

User selects one or more. Only selected paths trigger assessment and planning.

**Human gate:** Yes — path selection is a major decision point.

### Phase A: Assessment (Per Selected Path)

Each assessment skill runs against the extraction outputs and produces findings + ADRs. No change from current behavior except: assessments are now informed by the behavioral specs (Track A Gherkin or Track B documentation) in addition to extraction data.

### Phase P: Planning (Per Selected Path — Enhanced)

Each planning skill produces increments in the standard format. **Key enhancement:** planners now also produce behavioral deltas alongside each increment:

| Track | Planner Output |
|-------|---------------|
| Track A | Increment plan + **Gherkin deltas** (new/modified scenarios) + **FRD deltas** |
| Track B | Increment plan + **Behavioral doc updates** (updated scenarios) + **Manual checklist updates** |

This ensures that when Phase 2 delivery begins, the test/verification artifacts are already scoped per increment — mirroring how greenfield generates Gherkin before implementation.

### Phase 2: Increment Delivery (Track-Aware)

Phase 2 adapts based on the feature's track assignment:

**Track A features (testable) — full greenfield pipeline:**
```
Update Gherkin (from deltas) → Update/add tests → Contracts → Implementation → Deploy → Verify
```
- Existing green baseline tests provide regression safety
- New/modified Gherkin scenarios define the increment's target behavior
- Red-green cycle: new tests fail, implementation makes them pass, baseline tests still pass

**Track B features (non-testable) — reduced pipeline:**
```
Update behavioral docs → Contracts → Implementation → Manual verification checklist → Deploy
```
- Unit tests are written where possible (isolated logic with no external deps)
- Integration/e2e tests are deferred until testability improves
- Manual verification checklist replaces automated verification at gates
- If testability improves during the project, a feature can be promoted from Track B → Track A

**Human gates remain the same** — PR review after implementation, deployment verification after deploy.

### Convergence

After planning, all paths (modernize, rewrite, extend, security, etc.) produce increments in the same format with the same track-aware delivery pipeline. The only difference is whether verification is automated (Track A) or manual (Track B).

## 3b. ADR Protocol

Architecture Decision Records are first-class artifacts in both greenfield and brownfield workflows.

### When ADRs Are Generated
- Greenfield Phase 1d (Tech Stack): Every significant technology choice
- Brownfield Testability Gate: Track selection decision (ADR documenting testability assessment)
- Brownfield Phase A (Assessment): Every path decision and significant finding
- Phase 2 Step 2 (Contracts): Significant API/contract design decisions
- Phase 2 Step 3 (Implementation): Deviations from established patterns
- Any human gate that results in a direction change

### ADR Lifecycle
Status: proposed → accepted (or rejected) → deprecated/superseded

### Storage
- Location: specs/adrs/adr-NNN-{slug}.md
- State: .spec2cloud/state.json tracks ADR numbers and records
- Commits: [adr] ADR-NNN: {title}

---

## 4. Parallelism Rules

Use `/fleet` or parallel agents when tasks are independent:

| Context | Parallel Tasks |
|---------|---------------|
| Step 1 | E2E specs for multiple flows; Gherkin for multiple FRDs; BDD tests for multiple features |
| Step 3 | API slice + Web slice (always parallel) |

**Sequential only:** Integration slice (needs API + Web), Step 4 (regression → deploy → smoke), across increments.

---

## 5. Protocols (via skills)

All protocols are defined in their respective skills. The orchestrator invokes them by name:

- **State management** → `state-management` skill (read/write `state.json`, schema, resume)
- **Commits** → `commit-protocol` skill (procedures, message formats)
- **Audit logging** → `audit-log` skill (format, what to log)
- **Human gates** → `human-gate` skill (pause, summarize, approve/reject)
- **Resume** → `resume` skill (check state, re-validate, continue)
- **Error handling** → `error-handling` skill (failures, stuck loops, corrupted state)

---

## 6. Skill Management

Skills follow the [agentskills.io specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) and are stored in `.github/skills/`.

### Skill Check (before every task)
1. Scan `.github/skills/` for a local skill matching the task
2. Search [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) for a community skill → `skill-discovery` skill
3. If a match exists → read the SKILL.md and follow its instructions
4. If no match → execute directly

### Creating Skills → `skill-creator` skill
When a reusable pattern emerges, create a new skill with proper frontmatter.

### Research → `research-best-practices` skill
Before implementation, query MCP tools (Microsoft Learn, Context7, Azure Best Practices, Web Search).

---

## 7. Stack Reference

**Stack:** Next.js (TypeScript, App Router) + Express.js (TypeScript, Node.js)

### Project Structure

```

```

### Test Commands

| Test Type | Command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Unit tests (API) | `cd src/api && npm test` | Vitest + Supertest, runs all API tests |
| Unit tests (API, watch) | `cd src/api && npm run test:watch` | Re-runs on file changes |
| Cucumber/Gherkin | `npx cucumber-js` | Runs against Aspire environment (auto-started by hooks via `aspire start` + `aspire wait`) |
| Playwright e2e | `npx playwright test --config=e2e/playwright.config.ts` | Runs against Aspire environment (auto-started by webServer config via `aspire start` + `aspire wait`) |
| Playwright specific | `npx playwright test e2e/{feature}.spec.ts` | Single feature e2e against Aspire |
| Playwright smoke | `npx playwright test --grep @smoke` | Smoke tests only |
| Playwright UI mode | `npx playwright test --ui` | Interactive debugging |
| All tests | `npm run test:all` | Unit + Cucumber + Playwright (all against Aspire) |

### Dev Server Commands

| Service | Command | URL |
|---|---|---|
| **Aspire (all services)** | `aspire start` | Web: http://localhost:3001, API: http://localhost:5001 |
| Wait for healthy | `aspire wait api --status healthy` | Blocks until API is ready |
| Describe resources | `aspire describe` | Show resource status, health, endpoints |
| View logs | `aspire logs <resource>` | Stream console logs for a resource |
| Stop Aspire | `aspire stop` | Clean shutdown of all resources |
| Frontend (standalone) | `cd src/web && npm run dev` | http://localhost:3000 |
| Backend (standalone) | `cd src/api && npm run dev` | http://localhost:5001 (dev) / 8080 (container) |

> **Always use `aspire start`** (background, non-blocking) — never `aspire run` (interactive, blocking). Use `aspire wait <resource> --status healthy` to block until a resource is ready. Use `aspire describe` to inspect resource status. The Aspire MCP server provides `list_resources`, `list_console_logs`, `list_traces` for runtime observability.

> **Prefer Aspire** for all integration, Cucumber, and e2e testing. Standalone dev servers are only for isolated slice work (API-only or Web-only development).

### Build Commands

| Target | Command |
|---|---|
| Frontend | `cd src/web && npm run build` |
| Backend | `cd src/api && npm run build` |
| Frontend lint | `cd src/web && npm run lint` |
| Backend lint | `cd src/api && npm run lint` |

### Deploy Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `azd provision` | Provision Azure resources (Container Apps, ACR, monitoring) |
| `azd deploy` | Build containers and deploy to Azure Container Apps |
| `azd env get-values` | Retrieve deployed URLs |

## 8. Research Protocol

Before writing implementation code, invoke the `research-best-practices` skill.
Consult `specs/tech-stack.md` first — most technology decisions are pre-resolved in Phase 1d.
For details, see the `research-best-practices` skill in `.github/skills/`.
